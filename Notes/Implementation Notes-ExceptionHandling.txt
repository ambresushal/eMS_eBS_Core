To utilize the exception handling and error logging component
1. Choose the option for ELMAH or LogToTextFile. In case if no option is specified, by default LogToTextFile would employed.
2. The keys are as follows
	<appSettings>
	    <add key="EnableELMAH" value="true" />
	    <add key="EnableLogToTextFile" value="true" />
 </appSettings>
3. ELMAH saves the errors, exceptions in database.
4. LogToTextFile saves the errors, exceptions in the text file located at "C\Equinox" which can be changed through
setting in "LoggingConfiguration.config"
5. For using these components into the code, following specimen be referred.

	 try
	         {
				// Add ur code here
	         }
		      catch (Exception ex)
	         {
				//For Asynchronous calling 
	
				bool rethrow = ExceptionPolicyWrapper.HandleExceptionAsync(ex, ExceptionPolicies.ExceptionShielding);
	
				//Or For Synchronous calling
	
				bool rethrow = ExceptionPolicyWrapper. HandleException (ex, ExceptionPolicies.ExceptionShielding);
	
	           if (rethrow) throw;
	
       }  
       
       Please note here that there are 2  mechanisms i.e. synchronous and asynchronous which are available and asynchronous mechanism is 
       recommended to derive the benefits of asynchronous programming in turn improving the performance and avoiding race conditions.
