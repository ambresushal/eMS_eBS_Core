Best practices for better database performance:
1.Create clustered index on every table to avoid failing of insert statements/Maintain primary keys for every tables.
2.Use normalized tables in the database.
3.Using JOIN is better for performance then using sub queries or nested queries
4.Use comments for readability as well guidelines for next developer who comes to modify the same code.
5.Store relevant and necessary information in the database instead of application structure.
6.Proper indexing will improve the speed of operations in the database
